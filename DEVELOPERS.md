Getting started
----

The implementation of the workflow in the different repositories of the source code for use. 
> **Recommendation:** Don't directly implement this flow in source repositories. Use an intermediate repository where you can configure the different tools (exemple sonar, veracode, etc). and that it can be executed, for example, by means of [weebhook](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks). This configuration allows to separate the repository from the workflow.

Usages
----
can be referenced as follows:

- **Implementation for desployment to develop environment:**
````
# Implementation for deployment to develop environment ( pull request event to develop branch )
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ develop ]
jobs:
- uses: ./.github/action/software/develop.yml@v1.0
  with:
    # Repository name with owner.
    # Default: ${{ github.repository }}
    repository: ''
````
- **Implementation for desployment to publish environment and tagging technical release:**
````
# Implementation for deployment to publish environment ( pull request event to main branch)
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
- uses: ./.github/action/software/release.yml@v1.0
  with:
    # Repository name with owner.
    # Default: ${{ github.repository }}
    repository: ''
