Getting started
----

The implementation of the workflow in the different repositories of the source code for use.

> **Recommendation:** Don't directly implement this flow in source repositories. Use an intermediate repository where you can configure the different tools (exemple sonar, veracode, etc). and that it can be executed, for example, by means of [weebhook](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks). This configuration allows to separate the repository from the workflow.

the workflow uses different tools to complete different scenarios such as checking in to derivative repositories or running a code scan. to configure the tools it is necessary to configure the authentication secrets. more information to [secret github](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
see [usages](#usages) for implementation

### Terraform modules:
github workflow using terraform to creates and applies an infrastructure using the vpc module first time. the [aws-ec2-vpc-iberia](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--workflow/blob/main/terraform/modules/aws-ec2-vpc-iberia/README.md) module is configured by environment through the file **terraform.tfvars** content:
`````
## Global variables
service_name       = "<service name>"
environment_prefix = "<environment prefix name>"
project            = "<project name>"                     # this name is present in domain <project name>.<domain>
environment        = "<enviroment name>"
aws_region         = "<regione name>"                     # default: "eu-central-1"
global_dns         = "<domain>"                           # default: "cloud.iberia.local"
bucket_name        = "<bucket name>"                      # set s3 backet for log
bucket_key         = "<bucket key>"                       # set s3 backet for log
dynamodb_table     = "<dynamo db>"
kms_key_id         = "<kms id>" 
role_arn           = "<regione name>"                     # AIM role aws
`````

to create an instance from an **ubuntu** image the following module [aws-ec2-instance-iberia](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--workflow/blob/main/terraform/modules/aws-ec2-instance-iberia/README.md)  is used , this allows to obtain an instance ready for application without keeping an image, while the image module [aws-ec2-image-iberia](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--workflow/blob/main/terraform/modules/aws-ec2-image-iberia/README.md)  is complementary to the instance module and It'll create an image from instance generate.

the deployment step of the workflow receives the publish aws AMI image and instantiates it on ec2, use module [aws-ec2-deploy-iberia](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--workflow/blob/main/terraform/modules/aws-ec2-deploy-iberia/README.md) 

To finish the monitoring module [aws-ec2-monitoring-iberia](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--workflow/blob/main/terraform/modules/aws-ec2-monitoring-iberia/README.md), associate the service and infrastructure to the monitoring tools of alert, logging, etc. for example cloudwatch.

The deployment process requires a repository of derivatives. it can only be of two types (nexus or codeartifact). deployment isn't possible if the repository isn't configured.

For the demonstration of the implementation, a [demo](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--demo/blob/main/README.md) has been designed that consumes this workflow.

Repository flow 
----
We have two working methods within the context of the repositories available in the reference architecture

### Github Flow, as default for Product-based development

GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. This guide explains how and why GitHub flow works.

The essence if Github Flow is explained in 6 points:

- Anything in the 'main' branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of 'main' (ie: new-oauth2-scopes)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into 'main'
- Once it is merged and pushed to 'main', you can and should deploy immediately

We refer to Github documentation for and [introduction](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and [deeper details](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow()).

### Git Flow, for applications that require Integration Environments 

We refer Integration Environments as a [Enterprise-wide integration test environments](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/enterprise-wide-integration-test-environments). In such case, it's necessary to keep running non-production environments that replacates the production behaviour with it's integrations.

Gitflow Workflow is a Git workflow that helps with continuous software development and implementing DevOps practice. Gitflow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle:

- The workflow is great for a release-based software workflow.
- Gitflow offers a dedicated channel for hotfixes to production.

The overall flow of Gitflow is:

- A develop branch is created from main
- A release branch is created from develop
- Feature branches are created from develop
- When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch
- When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and main
- If an issue in main is detected a hotfix branch is created from main
- Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and main

More detailed description on how to implement a gitflow is explained [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
