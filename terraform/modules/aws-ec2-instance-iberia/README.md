* artifact_secret:  "The secret key access to read register artifact. example: Nexus"
* security_group:   "The security group to deploy"
* subnet_target:    "The subnet id target to deploy ec2 instance"

**output**

**Other configuration**

To allow cloudwatch to retrieve the metrics from the instance, it is necessary to install the agent. This agent requires a manual configuration of the json. the json file must be hosted in the instance and parameterized by service. see [config Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Details.html)
