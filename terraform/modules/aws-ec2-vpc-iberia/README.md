AWS EC2 VPC Module
----
The vpc module creates the entire infrastructure of an amazon virtual private network on EC2 with 3 subnets (blue, green, amber)
set segurity group, domain, load balancer, target group, etc.

> The module doesn't currently create a private subnet for the data models connected by tcp to the subnets of the application server
> The provider has configured the s3 backet where it will host the logs

It is possible to implement the module in a parent module to use the vpn creation in other infrastructure processes by code. more information with [modules](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/syntax)

module "vpc" {
  source = "./terraform/modules/aws-ec2-vpc-iberia"

The deployment step of the workflow continous integration this modules receives the aws AMI image and instantiates it on EC2 with next param
